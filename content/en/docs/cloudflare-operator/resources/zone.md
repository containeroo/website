The API specification can be viewed [here](/docs/cloudflare-operator/api_reference/#cloudflare-operator.io/v1.Zone).

Zone resources represent the zones available in the Cloudflare account.
They are used to store the zone id and **are fully managed by cloudflare-operator**.

Therefore, you should not create or modify zone resources manually.
