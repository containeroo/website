The API specification can be viewed [here](/docs/cloudflare-operator/api_reference/#cloudflare-operator.io/v1.Zone).

Zone resources represent Cloudflare zones and are used to tell cloudflare-operator which zones to manage.

Learn more about the zone resource in the [getting started guide](/docs/cloudflare-operator/get_started).
