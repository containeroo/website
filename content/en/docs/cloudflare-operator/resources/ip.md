The API specification can be viewed [here](/docs/cloudflare-operator/api_reference/#cf.containeroo.ch/v1beta1.IP).

As described in the [core concept](/docs/cloudflare-operator/core_concepts/#ip-objects), IP objects can be used
to follow the "don't repeat yourself" (DRY) principle.

They also allow you to use the same IP address in multiple DNS records and let you use cloudflare-operator
as a dynamic DNS service.

Learn more about the usage of IP objects in the [dynamic DNS guide](/docs/cloudflare-operator/guides/dynamic_ip).
